# Responsive content reference wireframes in a blueprint style

Based on [Stephen Hays' idea of content reference wireframes](http://responsivedesignworkflow.com/) and some [sightings on Dribbble](https://dribbble.com/shots/782399-Blueprint-Wireframe).

## Idea

Static wireframes aren't always the best option for responsive workflows, nor are too detailed wireframes. By creating simple sketches in HTML and using the blueprint metaphor, this little toolkit aims to match both modern device contexts and the fact that wireframes are not design proposals.
